About
-----

This is a script to make my life easier. It downloads, installs
and sets most of the stuff I use all the time. So when I install
another Ubuntu OS on my computer I will have most of the initial
stuff automated.

Instructions
------------

Before running any script, double check that everything is how
it's supposed to be. Comment out the lines you don't want. And
write new lines for things that I forgot, or didn't care at the
time. That's it. Cheers.
